libraQM installation is necessary for complex text rendering 
sudo pip3 install Pillow -> installs 5.4.1
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev gtk-doc-tools
Install libraqm as described here (using configure, make, make install) ./autogen.sh give sudo if necessary like sudo make
sudo ldconfig This step was needed!
Run the following test script: (Make sure the fonts are installed sudo apt install fonts-indic)


sudo apt-get install libtool
apt-get install autoconf
